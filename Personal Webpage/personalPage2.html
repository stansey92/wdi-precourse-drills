        <h2> Why did I come to Galvanize? </h2>
        <h3> I spent the last 3 years as a Packaging Engineer at a medical device company called Medtronic. The job made me miserabe, I hated the corporate culture/atmosphere and spending most of my day sitting in a cubicle doing what seemed like pointless paperwork. A few months ago I decided I needed a change and started looking into various options. Coding bootcamps popped up and seemed interesting, so here I am! </h3>
